A simple Qt Widget app which displays a login dialog and reads in valid users from a basic JSON file. 

It will also render web pages using QtWebEngine's Chromium backend, although the implementation is as basic as it gets and probably broken. 

Made with Qt 5.12 in Qt Creator 4.9.2 and compiled with the included MSVC 2017 64 bit.

Users logins:

{
    "John": "secret",
    "Jaine": "secret"
}
