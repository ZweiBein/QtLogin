A simple Qt Widget app which displays a login dialog and reads in valid users from a basic JSON file. 

It will also render web pages using QtWebEngine's Chromium backend, although the implementation is as basic as it gets and it's prone to crashing.

Made with Qt 5.12 in Qt Creator 4.9.2

User logins:

{
    "John": "secret",
    "Jaine": "secret"
}
